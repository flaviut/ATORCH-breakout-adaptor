A PCB to adapt an ATorch-style load breakout board to be compatible with other electronic loads.

These breakouts are cheap and extremely convenient. But they have an unusual interface.

## BOM

- 7.62 pitch, 4 pin terminal block (for example, DORABO DB910-7.62-4P-GN-S)
- 1 meter BNC cable (75/50Î© doesn't matter, other end doesn't matter) or other 2-pin cable for voltage sense
- 1x red, 1x black banana jack

## Fabrication

Grab the latest gerbers from the releases in the side panel ->

## Assembly
